Experience
----------

**+rehabstudio Ltd.** - Backend Web Developer

*November 2014 - October 2016 (2 years)*

My main role at rehabstudio was as a Backend Web Developer, writing web services and APIs mainly in Python:

* Strong experience with Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask, webapp2

* REST API design, including integration / translation with SOAP API services (Adwords API, etc.)

I was also responsible for DevOps in the company, including writing and maintaining toolsets, deployment and automated test setups:

* Heave use of Docker, Compose and Make for automated dev run/test/deployment
  setups that would run across many platforms

C++ and Python developer for the Global Market Data Engineering group. I worked on various products that provided low latency, synthetic data feeds, as well as writing market data feed handlers, volume calculators, etc.

I also wrote a stack of Python development tools using coroutines for handling various market data formats, acting as recorders, readers and publishers. I also wrote a replacement for an archaic C++ web application, using a modern Flask implementation written in Python.


**CloudOpt Incorporated** - Development Engineer

*June 2012 - November 2012 (6 months)*

A startup company from Seattle based in Belfast, CloudOpt developed a cloud optimisation solution that incorporated data de-duplication and data compression to transparently accelerate data transfer speeds for customers systems between their offices and the cloud.

Over the 6 months I worked on many different projects, including:

* Reorganization and maintenance of their Jenkins continuous integration system

* Development of a Linux Live-CD to show off the end product to customers

* Python development on their Flask based web front-end


**Pace plc.** - Placement Development Engineer

*June 2011 - June 2012 (1 year 1 month)*

I worked for a year for the Elements Software Group – a division of Pace plc. that delivers TV media head-end, middleware and UI components. Over the year I did the preliminary work, development, and maintenance of many systems now in permanent use by the team, including:

* Development of advanced continuous integration solution with BuildBot

* Writing RPM-based distribution management tools, including managing a Linux distribution, release cycles, software maintenance and testing

* Development of a modular automated testing framework, implementing unit tests, system testing, and full designer test runs, with graphical reporting tools

* Integration of the above systems as an end-to-end development/test/deployment solution


**McDonald's Corporation** - Crew Member

*June 2006 - August 2009 (3 year 3 months)*

I worked as a McDonald's employee for 3 years. I learnt many valuable skills in my time working there. From working in a team, to meeting demand, organising a working shift to be most optimal, to dealing with customer complaints and enquiries.


**University of Ulster** - IT Support

*February 2007 (1 month)*

I worked under an IT Support staff role at the University of Ulster for a week in my lower sixth year. I experienced many different areas of work that the IT support team did, from fixing printer jams, to managing databases, imaging labs of systems, and migrating users from a Novell Netware network to the replacement Active Directory network.


Technical Experience
--------------------

[qcacher] (eSports & Gaming CDN cache service)
:   One of my current side projects is qcacher, a service designed for
    long-term caching of various content networks related to gaming. Design
    considered different scenarios, so we could maximize efficiency of fast
    connections with multiple clients, but also deliver long-term reliability
    and resiliency of caching when paired with slow, or intermittent
    connections.

    * Docker based setup for minimal management fuss and flexible
      configuration, configurable with Compose
    * Concentrated around three services: Nginx, Unbound, and SNIProxy
    * Studied CDN structure and capabilities of 8 distinct providers, to
      tailor features and functionality to best suit both the content
      provider's limitations, and maximise efficiency with connected clients


Open Source
:   I've made small contributions to various projects, including but not
    limited to the following:
    
    * [pioq3](Quake 3 for Raspberry Pi), where I wrote OpenGL ES and network
      code to enable support for the Raspberry Pi based on a modern version of
      [ioquake3]'s codebase
    * Patches to the [Git] project for improved support of [Perforce]
      repositories
    List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
